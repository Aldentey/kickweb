		<h1>Showdown</h1>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana">
We got, places to go
Things to do, people to see
And we gotta get it done right away
So few in the crew
Guess we a team
Thicker than thieves and we all tryna help find a way
If you know the destination we making conversation
		</pre>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana; color: red;">
Time is ticking, sun is setting we got no time for waiting
		</pre>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana">
Likely to showdown looks like it's bout to go down
		</pre>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana; color: red;">
Bust through with the cannon at the hold down
So we won't fall until gravity is gone
We been on this road too long
So long
And I can't stop, we can't stop
I'm so far away from home
We been on this road too long
Too long
Playing with fire
Take me higher
We're on our way
We're on our way
Undivided and Ignited
We're on our way
We're on our way
		</pre>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana">
Moving low key but somehow we make a scene
		</pre>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana; color: red;">
Doing what we gotta do to get from A to B
Pretty handy with the tool hit you with the beam
		</pre>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana">
Wouldn't have came this far if it wasn't for the team
My face you can't erase out of things you can't relate
No losing this race trust just be choosing your fate
Lies and truth on yo face where frames you can't replace
Trust in me and we can make it right again
All we need we got it already
Come with me and we can take it right again
		</pre>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana; color: red;">
I can feel us burning wider
Playing with fire
Take me higher
We're on our way
We're on our way
Undivided and Ignited
We're on our way
We're on our way
		</pre>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana">
On our way we're goin
And no mistakes while we're rolling around town
We just keep that crown
You don't want to show how
		</pre>
		<pre style="font-family: verdana; color: red;">
Might be a showdown
